Chrome Extension Hackthon (Health Hackers)
Challenges:
1. Figuring out what a chrome extension is (watching bad youtube tutorial videos about chrome extension on 4x speed)
2. Manifest.json and how to format it and what is manifest version.
3. chrome.runtime.onStartup.addListener(function() -> manifest version (still don't know) -> Chrome's Web Store will block new Manifest V2 extensions from being accepted from January 17, 2022 onward.
4. Managing fatigue, exhaustion, brain fog, noodle brain/spaghetti code, memory loss, aphasia
5. "matches": ["<all_urls>"] --> further areas of improvements: need to improve (every new URL causes new set of alerts), DRY code, making it modular
